# Multi-Layer-Perceptron

Maybe I'll add more functionalities. For the moment I've tested it as a function aproximator and a classifier with good results.
It only works with 2D data, so, for function aproximation the training set must be like y = f(x), and to make it work as a 
classifier, it must be as (X,Y) = Z.

As soon as I finish this mini project, I'll add more documentation.
